<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
You will do a sequence of labs in 6.858. These labs will give you
practical experience with common attacks and counter-measures.  To make the
issues concrete, you will explore the attacks and counter-measures in the
context of the zoobar web application in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>Lab 1: you will explore the zoobar web application,
and use buffer overflow attacks to break its security properties.
<li>Lab 2: you will improve the zoobar web application by using privilege
separation, so that if one component is compromised, the adversary doesn't get
control over the whole web application.
<li>Lab 3: you will build a program analysis tool based on symbolic
execution to find bugs in Python code such as the zoobar web application.
<li>Lab 4: you will improve the zoobar application against browser attacks.
</ul>

<p>
Lab 1 will introduce you to buffer overflow vulnerabilities, in the context of a
web server called <tt>zookws</tt>. The <tt>zookws</tt> web server runs a
simple python web application, <tt>zoobar</tt>, with which users transfer "zoobars"
(credits) between each other.  You will find buffer overflows in
the <tt>zookws</tt> web server code, write exploits for the buffer overflows to
inject code into the server over the network, and figure out how to bypass
non-executable stack protection.  Later labs look at other security aspects of
the <tt>zoobar</tt> and <tt>zookws</tt> infrastructure.

<p>Each lab requires you to learn a new programming language or some other piece
of infrastructure.  For example, in this lab you must become intimately familiar
with certain aspects of the C language, x86 assembly language, <tt>gdb</tt>,
etc.  Detailed familiarity with many different pieces of infrastructure
is needed to understand attacks and defenses
in realistic situations: security weaknesses often show up in corner cases, and
so you need to understand the details to craft exploits and design defenses for
those corner cases.  These two factors (new infrastructure and details) can make
the labs time consuming.  You should start early on the labs and work on them
daily for some limited time (each lab has several exercises), instead of trying
to do all exercises in a single shot just before the deadline. Take the time to
understand the relevant details. If you get stuck, post a question on <a
href="https://piazza.com/class/jrgkz27je7xh">Piazza</a>.

<p>Several labs, including this lab, ask you to design exploits.  These exploits
are realistic enough that you might be able to use them for a real attack, but
you should <i>not</i> do so.  The point of the designing exploits is to teach
you how to defend against them, not how to use them---attacking computer systems
is illegal
(see <a href="http://ist.mit.edu/network/rules">MIT network rules</a>)
and can get you into serious trouble.  Don't do it.

<p><b>NOTE:</b> Since we re-use the same lab assignments across years,
we ask that you please do not make your lab code publicly accessible
(e.g., by checking your solutions into a public repository on
GitHub).  This helps keep the labs fair and interesting for students in
future years.


<h2>Lab infrastructure</h2>

<p>
Exploiting buffer overflows requires precise control over the execution
environment.  A small change in the compiler, environment variables, or
the way the program is executed can result in slightly different memory
layout and code structure, thus requiring a different exploit.  For this
reason, this lab uses a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">virtual machine</a> to
run the vulnerable web server code.

<p>
To start working on this lab assignment, you'll need software that lets you run
a virtual machine. For Linux users, we recommend running the course VM on
<a href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/">KVM</a>, which is built into the Linux
kernel. KVM should be available through your distribution, and is preinstalled
on Athena cluster computers; on Debian or Ubuntu, try <span
class="ttytype">apt-get install qemu-kvm</span>.  KVM requires
hardware virtualization support in your CPU,  and you must enable this support in
your BIOS (which is often, but not always, the default).  If you have another
virtual machine monitor installed on your machine (e.g., VMware), that virtual
machine monitor may grab the hardware virtualization support exclusively and
prevent KVM from working.

<p>
On Windows, or Linux without KVM, use
<a href="https://ist.mit.edu/vmware/workstation">VMware Player</a> from
IS&amp;T.  On a Mac, use
<a href="http://ist.mit.edu/vmware-fusion/">VMWare Fusion</a>.

<p>
Once you have virtual machine software installed on your machine, you should
download
the <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/jfrg/6.858-x86_64-v19.zip">course VM
image</a>, and unpack it on your computer.  This virtual machine contains an
installation of <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> 9.7 Linux.

<p> To start the course VM using VMware, import <tt>6.858-x86_64-v19.vmdk</tt>.
Go to File &gt; New, select "create a custom virtual machine", choose Linux
&gt; Debian 9.x 64-bit, choose Legacy BIOS, and use an existing virtual disk
(and select the <tt>6.858-x86_64-v19.vmdk</tt> file, choosing the "Take this
disk away" option). Finally, click Finish to complete the setup.

<p>
To start the VM with kvm, run <span
class="ttytype">./6.858-x86_64-v19.sh</span> from a terminal (<tt>Ctrl+A x</tt>
to force quit). If you get a permission denied error from this script,
try adding yourself to the <tt>kvm</tt> group with 
<tt>sudo gpasswd -a `whoami` kvm</tt>,
then log out and log back in.

<p>
You'll use two accounts on the VM:

<table class="table">
<tr><th>Username</th><th>Password</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><tt>root</tt></td><td>6858</td>
<td>You can use the <tt>root</tt> account to install new software packages
with
<span class="ttytype">apt-get install <i>pkgname</i></span>. Or you
can log in as <tt>httpd</tt> and run
<span class="ttytype">sudo</span>.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><tt>httpd</tt></td><td>6858</td>
<td>You should use the
<tt>httpd</tt> account for your work.  
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p id="ssh">
You can either log into the virtual machine using its console, or use ssh to
log into the virtual machine over the (virtual) network. The latter also lets
you easily copy files into and out of the virtual machine with <tt>scp</tt> or
<tt>rsync</tt>. How you access the virtual machine over the network depends on
how you're running it. If you're using VMWare, you'll
first have to find the virtual machine's IP address. To do so, log in as root
on the console, run <span class="ttytype">ip addr show dev eth0</span>, and
note the IP address listed beside <tt>inet</tt>. With kvm, you can use
<tt>localhost</tt> as the IP address for ssh and HTTP. You can now log in with
ssh by running the following command from your host machine:
<span class="ttytype">ssh -p 2222 httpd@IPADDRESS</span>. To avoid having to
type the password each time, you may want to set up an <a
href="https://www.booleanworld.com/set-ssh-keys-linux-unix-server/">SSH
Key</a>.

<h2><a name="getting_started">Getting started</a></h2>
The files you will need for this and subsequent labs
are distributed using the <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> version control
system. You can also use Git to keep track of any changes you make to the
initial source code. Here's an
<a href="https://hacker-tools.github.io/version-control/">overview
of Git</a> and the
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html">Git
user's manual</a>, which you may find useful.

<p>
The course Git repository is available at
<span class="ttytype">https://web.mit.edu/6858/2019/lab.git</span>.
To get the lab code, log into the VM using the <tt>httpd</tt> account and
clone the source code for lab 1 as follows:

<pre class="tty">
httpd@6858-v19:~$ <span class="ttytype">git clone https://web.mit.edu/6858/2019/lab.git</span>
Cloning into 'lab'...
httpd@6858-v19:~$ <span class="ttytype">cd lab</span>
httpd@6858-v19:~/lab$
</pre>

<p>
Before you proceed with this lab assignment, make sure you can compile
the <tt>zookws</tt> web server:

<pre class="tty">
httpd@6858-v19:~/labs$ <span class="ttytype">make</span>
cc zookd.c -c -o zookd.o -m64 -g -std=c99 -Wall -D_GNU_SOURCE -static -fno-stack-protector

httpd@6858-v19:~/labs$
</pre>

<p>
  The component of <tt>zookws</tt> that receives HTTP requests
  is <tt>zookd</tt>.  It is written in C and serves static files and executes
  dynamic scripts. For this lab you don't have to understand the dynamic
  scripts; they are written in Python and the exploits in this lab apply only to
  C code. The HTTP-related code is in <tt>http.c</tt>.
  <a href="http://www.garshol.priv.no/download/text/http-tut.html">Here</a> is a
  tutorial about the HTTP protocol. 
</p>

<p>
There are two versions of <tt>zookd</tt> you will be using:
<ul>
  <li> <tt>zookd-exstack</tt>
  <li> <tt>zookd-nxstack</tt>
</ul>
<tt>zookd-exstack</tt> has an executable stack, which makes it easy to inject
executable code given a stack buffer overflow vulnerability.
<tt>zookd-nxstack</tt> has a non-executable stack, and requires a more
sophisticated attack to exploit stack buffer overflows.

<p>
In order to run the web server in a predictable fashion---so that its
stack and memory layout is the same every time---you will use the
<tt>clean-env.sh</tt> script.  This is the same way in which we will
run the web server during grading, so make sure all of your exploits
work on this configuration!

<p>
The reference binaries of <tt>zookd</tt> are provided in <tt>bin.tar.gz</tt>,
which we will use for grading. Make sure your exploits work on those binaries.
The <span class="ttytype">make check</span> command will always use both
<tt>clean-env.sh</tt> and <tt>bin.tar.gz</tt> to check your submission.

<p>
Now, make sure you can run the <tt>zookws</tt> web server
and access the <tt>zoobar</tt> web application from a browser
running on your machine, as follows:

<pre class="tty">
httpd@6858-v19:~/lab$ <span class="ttytype">./clean-env.sh ./zookd 8080</span>
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>./clean-env.sh</tt> commands starts <tt>zookd</tt> on port 8080.
To open the zoobar application, open your browser and point it at the URL
<tt>http://IPADDRESS:8080/</tt>, where <tt>IPADDRESS</tt> is the VM's IP
address we found <a href="#ssh">above</a>. If something doesn't seem to be
working, try to figure out what went wrong, or contact the course staff, before
proceeding further.

<p>
<h2>Part 1: Finding buffer overflows</h2>

<p>
In the first part of this lab assignment, you will find buffer overflows
in the provided web server.  To do this lab, you will need to understand
the basics of buffer overflows.  To help you get started with this, you
should read <a
href="https://thesquareplanet.com/blog/smashing-the-stack-21st-century/">Smashing
the Stack in the 21st Century</a>, which goes through the details of how buffer
overflows work, and how they can be exploited.

<p>
<div class="todo required">
<p>
<span class="header">Exercise 1.</span>  Study the web server's C code (in
<tt>zookd.c</tt> and <tt>http.c</tt>), and find one example of code that allows
an attacker to overwrite the return address of a function. Hint: look for
buffers allocated on the stack.  Write down a description of the vulnerability
in the file <tt>answers.txt</tt>.  For
your vulnerability, describe the buffer which may overflow, how you would
structure the input to the web server (i.e., the HTTP request) to overflow the
buffer and overwrite the return address, and the call stack that will trigger
the buffer overflow (i.e., the chain of function calls starting
from <tt>process_client</tt>).

<p>It is worth taking your time on this exercise and familiarizing yourself with
the code, because your next job is to exploit the vulnerability you identified.
In fact, you may want to go back and forth between this exercise and Exercises 2
and 3, as you work out the details and document them.  That is, if you find a
buffer overflow that you think can be exploited, you can use Exercises 2 and 3 to figure out
if it indeed can be exploited. It will be helpful to draw a stack diagram like
the figures
  in  <a href="https://thesquareplanet.com/blog/smashing-the-stack-21st-century/">Smashing
    the Stack in the 21st Century</a>.
</div>

<p>
Now, you will start developing exploits to take advantage of the buffer
overflows you have found above.  We have provided template Python code
for an exploit in <tt>/home/httpd/lab/exploit-template.py</tt>, which
issues an HTTP request.  The exploit template takes two arguments, the
server name and port number, so you might run it as follows to issue a
request to <tt>zookws</tt> running on localhost:

<pre class="tty">
httpd@6858-v19:~/lab$ <span class="ttytype">./clean-env.sh ./zookd-exstack 8080 &amp;</span>
[1] 2676
httpd@6858-v19:~/lab$ <span class="ttytype">./exploit-template.py localhost 8080</span>
HTTP request:
GET / HTTP/1.0

...
httpd@6858-v19:~/lab$
</pre>

<p>
You are free to use this template, or write your own exploit code
from scratch.  Note, however, that if you choose to write your own
exploit, the exploit must run correctly inside the provided virtual
machine.

<p>
You may find <tt>gdb</tt> useful in building your exploits (though it is
not required for you to do so).  As
<tt>zookd</tt> forks off many processes (one for each client), it can be
difficult to debug the correct one. The easiest way to do this is to run the web
server ahead of time with <tt>clean-env.sh</tt> and then attaching <tt>gdb</tt>
to an already-running process with the <tt>-p</tt> flag.  You can find the PID
of a process by using <tt>pgrep</tt>; for example, to attach to
<tt>zookd-exstack</tt>, start the server and, in another shell, run

<pre class="tty">
httpd@6858-v19:~/lab$ <span class="ttytype">gdb -p $(pgrep zookd-)</span>
...
(gdb) <span class="ttytype">break <var>your-breakpoint</var></span>
Breakpoint 1 at 0x1234567: file zookd.c, line 999.
(gdb) <span class="ttytype">continue</span>
Continuing.
</pre>

<p>
Keep in mind that a process being debugged by <tt>gdb</tt> will not
get killed even if you terminate the parent <tt>zookd</tt> process
using <tt>^C</tt>.  If you are having trouble restarting the web server,
check for leftover processes from the previous run, or be sure to exit
<tt>gdb</tt> before restarting <tt>zookd</tt>. You can also save yourself some
typing by using <tt>b</tt> instead of <tt>break</tt>, and <tt>c</tt> instead of
<tt>continue</tt>.

<p>
When a process being debugged by <tt>gdb</tt> forks, by default
<tt>gdb</tt> continues to debug the parent process and does not attach
to the child. Since <tt>zookd</tt> forks a child process to service
each request, you may find it helpful to have <tt>gdb</tt> attach to
the child on fork, using the command <tt>set follow-fork-mode child</tt>.
We have added that command to <tt>/home/httpd/lab/.gdbinit</tt>, which
will take effect if you start <tt>gdb</tt> in that directory.

<p>
For this and subsequent exercises, you may need to encode your attack
payload in different ways, depending on which vulnerability you are
exploiting.  In some cases, you may need to make sure that your attack
payload is URL-encoded; that is, use <code>+</code> instead of
space and <code>%2b</code> instead of <code>+</code>.  Here is a <a
href="http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/html/topics/urlencoding.htm">URL
encoding reference</a> and a handy <a
href="https://www.url-encode-decode.com/.">conversion
tool</a>. You can also use quoting functions in the python <tt>urllib</tt>
module to URL encode strings.  In other cases, you may need to include
binary values into your payload.  The Python
<a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/struct.html">struct</a> module
can help you do that.  For example, <tt>struct.pack("&lt;Q", x)</tt> will
produce an 8-byte (64-bit) binary encoding of the integer <tt>x</tt>.

<p>
<div class="todo required">
<p>
<span class="header">Exercise 2.</span>

Write an exploit that uses a buffer overflow
to crash the web server (or one of the processes it creates).
You do not need to inject code at
this point.  Verify that your exploit crashes the server by
checking the last few lines of <tt>dmesg | tail</tt>, using
<tt>gdb</tt>, or observing that the web server crashes (i.e., it will print <tt>
  Child process 9999 terminated incorrectly, receiving signal 11</tt>)

<p>
Provide the code for the exploit in a file called <tt>exploit-2.py</tt>.

<p>
The vulnerability you found in Exercise 1 may be too hard to exploit.
Feel free to find and exploit a different vulnerability.
</div>

<p>
You can check whether your exploits crash the server as follows:

<pre class="tty">
httpd@6858-v19:~/lab$ <span class="ttytype">make check-crash</span>
</pre>

<p>
<h2>Part 2: Code injection</h2>

<p>
In this part, you will use your buffer overflow exploits to inject
code into the web server.
The goal of the injected code will be to unlink (remove) a
sensitive file on the server, namely <tt>/home/httpd/grades.txt</tt>.
Use <tt>zookd-exstack</tt>,
since it has an executable stack that makes it easier to inject
code. The <tt>zookws</tt> web server should be started as follows.
<pre class="tty">
httpd@6858-v19:~/lab$ <span class="ttytype">./clean-env.sh ./zookd-exstack 8080</span>
</pre>

<p>
You can build the exploit in two steps.  First, write the shell code
that unlinks the sensitive file, namely <tt>/home/httpd/grades.txt</tt>.
Second, embed the compiled shell code in an HTTP request that
triggers the buffer overflow in the web server.

<p>
When writing shell code, it is often easier to use assembly language rather
than higher-level languages, such as C.  This is because the exploit
usually needs fine control over the stack layout, register values and code
size.  The C compiler will generate additional function preludes and perform various
optimizations, which makes the compiled binary code unpredictable.

<p>
We have provided shell code for you to use in
<tt>/home/httpd/lab/shellcode.S</tt>, along with <tt>Makefile</tt>
rules that produce <tt>/home/httpd/lab/shellcode.bin</tt>, a compiled
version of the shell code, when you run <span class="ttytype">make</span>.
The provided shell code is intended to exploit setuid-root binaries, and thus it
runs a shell.  You will need to modify this shell code to instead unlink
<tt>/home/httpd/grades.txt</tt>.

<p>
To help you develop your shell code for this exercise, we have
provided a program called <tt>run-shellcode</tt> that will run your
binary shell code, as if you correctly jumped to its starting point.
For example, running it on the provided shell code will cause the program
to <tt>execve("/bin/sh")</tt>, thereby giving you another shell prompt:

<pre class="tty">
httpd@6858-v19:~/lab$ <span class="ttytype">./run-shellcode shellcode.bin</span>
</pre>

<p>
<div class="todo required">
<p>
<span class="header">Exercise 3 (warm-up).</span>
Modify <tt>shellcode.S</tt> to unlink <tt>/home/httpd/grades.txt</tt>.
Your assembly code can either invoke the <tt>SYS_unlink</tt> system call,
or call the <tt>unlink()</tt> library function.
</div>

<p>
To test whether the shell code does its job, run the following commands:

<pre class="tty">
httpd@6858-v19:~/lab$ <span class="ttytype">make</span>
httpd@6858-v19:~/lab$ <span class="ttytype">touch ~/grades.txt</span>
httpd@6858-v19:~/lab$ <span class="ttytype">./run-shellcode shellcode.bin</span>
# Make sure /home/httpd/grades.txt is gone
httpd@6858-v19:~/lab$ <span class="ttytype">ls ~/grades.txt</span>
ls: cannot access /home/httpd/grades.txt: No such file or directory
</pre>

<p>You may find <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/strace">strace</a> useful
when trying to figure out what system calls your shellcode is making. Much like
with <tt>gdb</tt>, you attach <tt>strace</tt> to a running program:

<pre class="tty">
httpd@6858-v19:~/lab$ <span class="ttytype">strace -f -p $(pgrep zookd-)</span>
</pre>

It will then print all of the system calls that program makes. If your shell
code isn't working, try looking for the system call you think your shell code
should be executing (i.e., <tt>unlink</tt>), and see whether it has the right
arguments.

<p>
Next, we construct a malicious HTTP request that injects the compiled
byte code to the web server, and hijack the server's control flow to
run the injected code.
When developing an exploit, you will have to think about what values
are on the stack, so that you can modify them accordingly.

<p>
When you're constructing an exploit, you will often need to know the
addresses of specific stack locations, or specific functions, in a
particular program.  One way to do this is to add <tt>printf()</tt>
statements to the function in question.  For example, you can use
<tt>printf("Pointer: %p\n", &x);</tt> to print the address of variable
<tt>x</tt> or function <tt>x</tt>.  However, this approach requires
some care: you need to make sure that your added statements are not
themselves changing the stack layout or code layout.  We (and <span
class="ttytype">make check</span>) will be grading the lab without any
<tt>printf</tt> statements you may have added.

<p>
A more fool-proof approach to determine addresses is to use
<tt>gdb</tt>.  For example, suppose you want to know the stack address
of the <tt>pn[]</tt> array in the <tt>http_serve</tt> function in
<tt>zookd-exstack</tt>, and the address of its saved return pointer.  You can
obtain them using <tt>gdb</tt> by first starting the web server (remember
<tt>clean-evn</tt>!), and then attaching <tt>gdb</tt> to it:

<pre class="tty">
httpd@6858-v19:~/lab$ <span class="ttytype">gdb -p $(pgrep zookd-)</span>
...
(gdb) <span class="ttytype">break http_serve</span>
Breakpoint 1 at 0x5555555561d2: file http.c, line 275.
(gdb) <span class="ttytype">continue</span>
Continuing.
</pre>

<p>
Be sure to run <tt>gdb</tt> from the <tt>~/lab</tt> directory, so
that it picks up the <tt>set follow-fork-mode child</tt> command from
<tt>~/lab/.gdbinit</tt>.  Now you can issue an HTTP request to the web
server, so that it triggers the breakpoint, and so that you can examine
the stack of <tt>http_serve</tt>.

<pre class="tty">
httpd@6858-v19:~/lab$ <span class="ttytype">curl localhost:8080</span>
</pre>

This will cause <tt>gdb</tt> to hit the breakpoint you set and halt execution,
and give you an opportunity to ask <tt>gdb</tt> for addresses you are
interested in:


<pre class="tty">
Thread 2.1 "zookd-exstack" hit Breakpoint 1, http_serve (fd=4, name=0x55555575f80c "/") at http.c:275
275         void (*handler)(int, const char *) = http_serve_none;
(gdb) <span class="ttytype">print &amp;pn</span>
$1 = (char (*)[2048]) 0x7fffffffd4b0
(gdb) <span class="ttytype">info frame</span>

</pre>

<p>
From this, you can tell that, at least for this invocation of
<tt>http_serve</tt>, the <tt>pn[]</tt> buffer on the stack lives at
address <tt>0x7fffffffd4b0</tt>, and the saved value of <tt>%rip</tt> (the
return address in other words) is at <tt>0x7fffffffdcd8</tt>. If you want to
see register contents, you can also use <span class="ttytype">info
registers</span>.

<p>
Now it's your turn to develop an exploit. 

<p>
<div class="todo required">
<p>
<span class="header">Exercise 3.</span>
Starting from one of your exploits from Exercise 2, construct an
exploit that hijacks the control flow of the web server and unlinks
<tt>/home/httpd/grades.txt</tt>.  Save this exploit in a file
called <tt>exploit-3.py</tt>.

<p>
Verify that your exploit works; you will need to re-create
<tt>/home/httpd/grades.txt</tt> after each successful exploit run.

<p>
Suggestion: first focus on obtaining control of the program counter.
Sketch out the stack layout that you expect the program to have
at the point when you overflow the buffer, and use <tt>gdb</tt>
to verify that your overflow data ends up where you expect it
to.  Step through the execution of the function to the return
instruction to make sure you can control what address the program
returns to.  The <tt>next</tt>, <tt>stepi</tt>, and <a
href="http://visualgdb.com/gdbreference/commands/x"><tt>x</tt></a> commands in
<tt>gdb</tt> should prove helpful.

<p>
Once you can reliably hijack the control flow of the program,
find a suitable address that will contain the code you want
to execute, and focus on placing the correct code at that
address---e.g. a derivative of the provided shell code.
</div>

<p>You can check whether your exploit works as follows:

<pre class="tty">
httpd@6858-v19:~/lab$ <span class="ttytype">make check-exstack</span>
</pre>

<p>
The test either prints "PASS" or "FAIL".
We will grade your exploits in this way. Do not change the <tt>Makefile</tt>.

<p>
The standard C compiler used on Linux, gcc, implements a version of
stack canaries (called SSP).  You can explore whether GCC's version of
stack canaries would or would not prevent a given vulnerability by using
the SSP-enabled versions of <tt>zookd</tt>: <tt>zookd-withssp</tt>.

<p>
Submit your answers to the first two parts of this lab assignment by running
<span class="ttytype">make submit-a</span>. Alternatively, run 
<span class="ttytype">make prepare-submit-a</span> and upload the resulting
<tt>lab1a-handin.tar.gz</tt> file to
<a href="handin.html">the submission web site</a>.

<p>
<h2>Part 3: Return-to-libc attacks</h2>

<p>
Many modern operating systems mark the stack non-executable in
an attempt to make it more difficult to exploit buffer overflows.
In this part, you will explore how this protection mechanism can
be circumvented.  Run the web server configured with binaries
that have a non-executable stack, as follows.
<pre class="tty">
httpd@6858-v19:~/lab$ <span class="ttytype">./clean-env.sh ./zookd-nxstack 8080</span>
</pre>

<p>
The key observation to exploiting buffer overflows with a
non-executable stack is that you still control the program counter,
after a <tt>ret</tt> instruction jumps to an address that you placed
on the stack.  Even though you cannot jump to the address of the
overflowed buffer (it will not be executable), there's usually enough
code in the vulnerable server's address space to perform the operation
you want.

<p>
Thus, to bypass a non-executable stack, you need to first find the code
you want to execute.  This is often a function in the standard library,
called libc, such as <tt>execve</tt>, <tt>system</tt>, or <tt>unlink</tt>.
Then, you need to arrange for the stack and registers to be in a state
consistent with calling that function with the desired arguments.
Finally, you need to arrange for the <tt>ret</tt> instruction to jump
to the function you found in the first step.  This attack is often
called a <i>return-to-libc</i> attack.

<p>
One challenge with return-to-libc attacks is that you need to pass arguments to
the libc function that you want to invoke.  The x86-64 calling conventions make
this a challenge because the first 6 arguments <a
href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/09/06/stack-frame-layout-on-x86-64">are
passed in registers</a>.
For example, the first argument must be in register <tt>%rdi</tt>
(see <tt>man 2 syscall</tt>, which documents the calling convention).  So, you
need an instruction that loads the first argument into <tt>%rdi</tt>. In
Exercise 3, you could have put that instruction in the buffer that your exploit
overflows.  But, in this part of the lab, the stack is marked non-executable, so
executing the instruction would crash the server, but wouldn't execute the
instruction.

<p>
The solution to this problem is to find a piece of code in the server that
loads an address into <tt>%rdi</tt>.  Such a piece of code is referred to as a
"borrowed code chunk", or more generally as a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming"><i>rop
gadget</i></a>, because it is a tool for return-oriented programming (rop).
Luckily, <tt>zookd.c</tt> accidentally has a useful gadget: see the function
<tt>accidentally</tt>.

<div class="todo required">
<p>
<span class="header">Exercise 4.</span>  Starting from your exploit in Exercise
2 and 3, construct an exploit that unlinks
<tt>/home/httpd/grades.txt</tt> when run on the binaries that have a
non-executable stack.  Name this new exploit <tt>exploit-4.py</tt>.

<p>
In this attack you are going to take control of the server over
the network <i>without injecting any code</i> into the server. You should use a
return-to-libc attack where you redirect control flow to code that already
existed before your attack. The outline of the attack is to perform a buffer
overflow that:

<ol>
    <li>causes the argument to the chosen libc function to be on stack
    <li>then causes <tt>accidentally</tt> to run so that argument ends up in <tt>%rdi</tt>
    <li>and then causes <tt>accidentally</tt> to return to the chosen libc function
</ol>

<p>
   It will be helpful to draw a stack diagram like
the figures
  in  <a href="https://thesquareplanet.com/blog/smashing-the-stack-21st-century/">Smashing
    the Stack in the 21st Century</a>  at (1)
the point that the buffer overflows and (2) at the point that
<tt>accidentally</tt> runs.
  
</div>

<p>You can test your exploits as follows:
<pre class="tty">
httpd@6858-v19:~/lab$ <span class="ttytype">make check-libc</span>
</pre>

<div class="todo challenge">
<p>
<span class="header">Challenge! (optional)</span>

The <tt>accidentally</tt> function is a bit artificial. Figure out how to
perform the return-to-libc attack without relying on that function (delete it
and find another way to make your exploit work).

<p>You will need to find another chunk of code to reuse that gives you control
over <tt>%rdi</tt>. You can read through the disassembly (e.g. using
<tt>objdump</tt>) to look for useful ROP gadgets.

<p>Because of the nature of x86/x86-64, you can use another technique to find
sequences of instructions that don't even appear in the disassembly!
Instructions are variable-length (from 1 to 15 bytes), and by causing a
misaligned parse (by jumping into the middle of an intended instruction), you
can cause a sequence of machine code to be misinterpreted. For example, the
instruction sequence <tt>pop %r15; ret</tt> corresponds to the machine code
<tt>41 5F C3</tt>. But instead of executing from the start of this instruction
stream, if you jump 1 byte in, the machine code <tt>5F C3</tt> corresponds to
the assembly <tt>pop %rdi; ret</tt>.

<p>Automated tools such as
<a href="https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget">ROPgadget.py</a> can
assist you in searching for ROP gadgets, even finding gadgets that arise from
misaligned parses.

<h2>Part 4: Fixing buffer overflows and other bugs</h2>

<p>
Now that you have figured out how to exploit buffer overflows,
you will try to find other kinds of vulnerabilities in the same
code.  As with many real-world applications, the "security" of
our web server is not well-defined.  Thus, you will need to use
your imagination to think of a plausible threat model and policy
for the web server.

<p>
<div class="todo required">
<p>
<span class="header">Exercise 5.</span>
Look through the source code and try to find more
vulnerabilities that can allow an attacker to compromise the
security of the web server.  Describe the attacks you have
found in <tt>answers.txt</tt>, along with an explanation of
the limitations of the attack, what an attacker can accomplish,
why it works, and how you might go about fixing or preventing it.
You should ignore bugs in <tt>zoobar</tt>'s code.  They will be addressed in
future labs.

<p>
One approach for finding vulnerabilities is to trace the flow
of inputs controlled by the attacker through the server code.
At each point that the attacker's input is used, consider all
the possible values the attacker might have provided at that
point, and what the attacker can achieve in that manner.
<p>
You should find at least two vulnerabilities for this exercise.
</div>

<p>
Finally, you will fix the vulnerabilities that you have exploited in
this lab assignment.

<p>
<div class="todo required">
<p>
<span class="header">Exercise 6.</span>  For each buffer overflow vulnerability
you have exploited in Exercises 2, 3, and 4, fix the web server's code to
prevent the vulnerability in the first place.  Do not rely on compile-time or
runtime mechanisms such
as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_buffer_overflow#Stack_canaries">stack
canaries</a>, removing <tt>-fno-stack-protector</tt>, baggy bounds checking,
etc.

<p>
Make sure that your code actually stops your exploits from working.
Use <span class="ttytype">make check-fixed</span> to run your exploits
against your modified source code (as opposed to the staff reference
binaries from <tt>bin.tar.gz</tt>).  These checks should report FAIL
(i.e., exploit no longer works).  If they report PASS, this means the
exploit still works, and you did not correctly fix the vulnerability.

<p>
Note that your submission should <i>not</i> make changes to the
<tt>Makefile</tt> and other grading scripts.  We will use our unmodified
version during grading.

<p>
You should also make sure your code still passes all tests using <span
class="ttytype">make check</span>, which uses the unmodified lab binaries.

</div>

<p>
You are done!
Submit your answers to the lab assignment by running
<span class="ttytype">make submit</span>. Alternatively, run 
<span class="ttytype">make prepare-submit</span> and upload the resulting
